# Sola
A Discord Bot for listening to Livestreams.

This Bot has been written as more-or-less oneshot project. I will add improvements over time, but probably won't expand beyond the current scope: a simple 24/7 Radio Bot.

## Setup

* You need gradle and a JDK (1.8 or greater).
* In your working directory, create a file `sola.txt` that contains your Discord Bot Token.
* Either run `gradle shadowJar` and the run the `*-all.jar` that will be created in `build/libs`, or directly use `gradle run`.
